# node_practice
practice website using Node.JS/Express/MongoDB

fun small project. Currently deciding what to add, I might combine this with my web scraper project.

All the cool kids are using node.JS/MongoDB so I wanted to join the fun :)

Currently have POST capabilities. 


Goals

Learn how to use GET requests to add stuff to DB

Figure out a data analysis program

Make the website look nice

Possible ideas?

Google large databases and play with them LOL

Price vs Time graphs

some current events thing? Maybe I can use Google Maps so it looks cool
